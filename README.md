## Review on Tactics Ogre Vanilla

> Tactics Ogre is a hard game for me to talk about. I really wanted to love it, but the gameplay is so rotten at the base level that it undermines the entire game. But first, lets talk about the good stuff (I'm talking about the PSP version btw).
> <!-- more -->
> The world building, story / plot and chracter development is phenomenal. Matsuno, as usual, delivers here. The characters are deep and interesting, the plot mature, with lot's of political backstabing. The world building is probably the best in a game of the genre.
> 
> Akihiko Yoshida's art is beautiful and lend itself perfectly to the tone of the game. I wish he worked on Fire Emblem, much better than what we got now.
> 
> Hitoshi Sakamoto's sountrack is also great as usual, with themes that fit perfectly. "Revolt" is so classic that it instantly reminds me of Ogre Battle.
> 
> But then we come to the gameplay. It's simply put, a mess. Where to begin?
> 
> First, the stats and calculations system is completely overdesigned and still to this day people don't know how it works exactly. But that's not the worst. Small changes in any stat causes huge variations in damage done and received. This means that if your character is even 1 level above or behind the enemy, you will either stomp or be stomped. There's too much emphasys on stats here to the point of undermining tactical and strategic considerations.
> 
> Then you have the skill system. You basically have to grind a lot to unlock skills, and the grinding is per character. The skill system is also completely overdesigned, with many skills just being stronger versions of previous ones. Other don't seem to work at all.
> 
> While the map layouts are interesting, with a lot of verticality, mission objectives are incredibly dull and just boil down to wiping out enemy forces. All maps play exact the same: march forward and meet with the enemy.
> 
> The class and level system is also poorly designed (PSP version here). Your characters don't have levels, your unlocked classes do. So picture this: you are at the middle of the game, with classes in the 10 level range. Then you unlock a new one, and naturally, want to try it. But is starts at level 1, making any character at that class completely useless in combat. You must do random battles, leave said unit in a corner and completel the map with your other units so it can leech exp. Completely boring and unacceptable.
> 
> There's more, such as the crafting system being the worst I've yet to see in a game. Sigh.
> 
> Anyway, my point is: everything about it is great, except the gameplay. My suggestion is to just watch a playthrough for the plot and characters. Don't bother suffering through it. To make matters worse, Square Enix did an epic release trailer for the game, which is pure fan service for fans of the Ogre Battle world. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIt4d-j9oo
> 
> Now, if you like SRPGs focused on grinding and sandboxish elements, where it's about creating broke combination of units that can stomp everything... by all means play it. It certainly isn't fun to me.

Having played *Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together* (PSP remake) and *Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis* (GBA) many years ago, I couldn't agree more with the comment cited above. TO is a rather easy game. 

- AI design: For every attack turn, a unit has too many options available while the simply designed AI just can't make a good choice. In contrast, in FE, very limited options are given. As a result, enemies are threatening even though they behave according to some very simple rules. They are threatening partly because player's team and AI's take turns as a whole not by character-wise, which makes killing a unit much easier (no FE core player would tolerate character death).
- Map design: TO's maps are cool but those interesting elements are just not expoited at all. While FE's maps are very well designed and even the grids are deliberately calculated (you may find many examples in *Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest*). Almost every components are made use of.

A detailed review can be found on [タクティクスオウガ 運命の輪 - ゲームカタログ@Wiki ～名作からクソゲーまで～ - アットウィキ](https://w.atwiki.jp/gcmatome/?cmd=word&word=タクティクスオウガ&type=&pageid=4623).

## One Vision Mod

I came across this mod one year ago when I wanted to figure out how the damage is calculated on earth, since it is really mysterious and confused me for many years. I searched in Japanese at first but failed to find any useful information. Then I tried in English and reached the calculation breakdown sheet. I noticed that the author had a mod called OV. I played with it and liked it very much. It fullfils my imagination when I first played this game years ago. So I began to propagate it in Chinese community. Now there are several people having played with this mod in China. While most are just scared away for being unable to read English.

The information for OV mod can be found [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/one-vision1).

## Useful Utils

2020/8/29

I tested and concluded the following results months ago and recently. The conclusions might be wrong since no systematic experiments were conducted. I'd appreciate it if you can point out any mistake I made.

You may also want to read [Buffs and Debuffs, and Interactions](https://nichegamescom.wordpress.com/2019/05/22/tactics-ogre-ov-debuffs-statuses-and-interactions-guide/) on Coffee Potato's blog. I learned a lot from his post, but also found that there are many mistakes, especially when it comes to some percentage calculation. In fact, many buffs and debuffs have been included in raics' damage calculation sheet, so I recommend reading it in the meantime.

### TP and MP

- TP generation speed is about 2 TP per 20 RT. They increase two by two, rather than one by one.
- MP generation speed is about 1.1x TP generation speed.
- TP gained by phisical attack = 0.25 * damage dealt + 0.4 * damage received
- Clarity 1 = 1.2x speed, Clarity 2 = 1.44x speed, Clarity 3 = 1.2^3x speed and so on. Tactician is also 1.2 and 1.44, respectively.
- Max TP doesn't boost TP generation speed, so does higher MP.

### Buffs, Debuffs, and Interactions

- When a unit is inflicted Slow, his RT is increased by 25% instantly. Then his total RT becomes 125% of the original until slow expires.
- When a unit is quicken, his RT is decreased by 25% instantly. Then his total RT becomes 75% of the original until quicken expires.
- Instill element bonus = 0.25 * total damage. It doesn't interact with ele aug.
- Curse suppresses Couterhit.
- Shackle doesn't suppress Counterhit.
- Leaden invalidates Waterwalk.
- Leaden prevents units from being knocked back since its icon seems quite heavy. Watch the video [here](https://www.acfun.cn/v/ac17664467_2) at around 29:20. (2020/8/30)
- Leaden reduces (physical) evasion by 30% (absolute value). (2020/8/30) raics: About leaden, it reduces melee evasion by 30% and ranged evasion by 40%
- Stun also reduces evasion, read more on [小ネタ・裏技 - タクティクスオウガ 運命の輪 攻略Wiki](http://masterwiki.net/tacticsogre/?%BE%AE%A5%CD%A5%BF%A1%A6%CE%A2%B5%BB#l4ad1fd8) (2020/9/14)

```
Version: 0.963

shackle (fire) lasts 3 turn
petrify (earth) 3 turn
sleep (light) 3 turn
stop (ice) 350 rt

find that if it is a turn based status, 
then the focus will be redirected temporaily to the target when his turn comes

slow (water) 350 (?) rt
quicken 350 (?) rt
shackle (dark) 2 turn
stop (dark) 250 (?) rt

Note: raics said slow lasts 450 RT.

when unit is incap, his rt cost is doubled
poisson (corrosion): 10 damage per around ? rt 9-10 (?) times in total
regenerate: about 10 times in total
```

### Misc

- When an enemy is bound and he uses an item to recover, then this turn he won't move.
- Enmies don't know if a unit has steadfast or not, so they always try to push back units (typically using a shield) standing near the pit. We can leverage this and deploy units with steadfast near the pit so that AI tends to use shields to hit them.
- Faces

- XX Ward / Absorb MP can be used to deal with Decoy. (2020/8/30)

### Cheatcode generator

I wrote several simple Python scripts to strengthen enemies. Below is one of them.

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JczBuTaADOI&list=PLe9SLfIN-tRglEfG7RnN7vex68fE2asdD)

```python
def skill_rank(left, right, rank=8):
    '''
    example: skill_rank(11, 11+12, 6)
    
    then all the skill ranks of the 11th - 22nd units (12 in total)
    on the field will be set rank 6,
    and effect will remain after the battle for your own characters
 
    you may use it, say, when you have a party of 10 units,
    and there are 12 enemies. then all the enemy
    skill ranks will be set 6

    note that guest has a different order. e.g. when you have
    a party of 10 units and a guest, the guest may not be
    the 11th unit
    '''
    print(f'_C0 No.{left}-{right-1} units on field all skills rank {rank}')
    for i in range(left-1, right-1):
        for j in range(10):
            loc = hex(0x005401D8 + 0x520*i + 0x6*j)
            loc = loc[:2] + '00' + loc[2:]
            print(f'_L {loc} 0x0000000{rank}')

skill_rank(11, 11+12, 6)
```

```python
def cur_hp(left, right, hp=1):
    '''
    example: cur_hp(11, 11+12, 1)
    
    then all the current of the 11th - 22nd units (12 in total)
    will be set 1, and will be killed by one hit

    you may use it, say, when you have a party of 10 units,
    and there are 12 enemies. then you can sweeping them out easily.
    used to skip some boring and repetitive maps

    note that if boss is set 1 hp, then he won't be killed forever
    while if others are set 0 hp, then they won't die forever even
    though they have 0 hp
    '''
    print(f'_C0 No.{left}-{right-1} units on field HP {hp}')
    for i in range(left-1, right-1):
        loc = hex(0x10540140 + 0x520*i)
        print(f'_L {loc} 0x0000000{hp}')

cur_hp(11, 11+12, 1)
```

You can use `cur_hp` together with the following code to skip battles.

```
_C0 Action Infinite
_L 0x00E3132C 0x00000000
_L 0x00E3134C 0x00000000
_L 0x00E3136C 0x00000000
```

```python
def max_hp(units, hp=999):
    '''
    example: max_hp([1, 13, 15], hp=777)

    Then the 1st, 13th and 15th units on the battle field have 777HP.
    Can be used to buff enemies to make game harder.

    This one is trickier to use.
    You must turn on it first, then quick save,
    turn it off, finally load quick save.
    Better follow the tutorial.
    '''
    print(f'_C0 No.{units} units on field HP {hp}')
    hp = hex(hp)[2:]
    hp = '0'*(3-len(hp)) + hp
    for u in units:
        print(f'_L {hex(0x10540140+0x520*(u-1))} 0x00000{hp}')
        print(f'_L {hex(0x10540146+0x520*(u-1))} 0x00000{hp}')

max_hp([14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 999)
```

## Playing Log

### Self-imposed Challenges

The following clauses aim at making the game more difficult. This is called「縛りプレイ」in Japanese.

> 様々な要素からゲームを今クリアするだけなら難易度が低いゲームに対し、自主的な制限をつけることで敢えて難易度を引き上げ、やりごたえのあるゲームを自ら作り上げる、と言うのが縛りプレイの主な趣旨である。Source: [ニコニコ大百科](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E7%B8%9B%E3%82%8A%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4)

Check [here](https://github.com/Shiina18/tactics_ogre_one_vision_mod_challenges) for the latest rules. (2020/9/27)

- **Class Clause**
    - The player cannot have two units with the same class on a team. 
        - All kinds of dragons are counted as one class.
    - A team cannot have more than 2 units with special (unique) classes in a 10-unit team, and 3 special classes in a 12-unit team. Any wingedman, monster, angel knight and undead is counted as special no matter what class he is.
    - ~~Denam must be Warrior.  (I follow this rule personally)~~
- **Weapon Clause**
    - The player cannot have "same" types of weapons on a team unless dual wielding. 
        - Sidegrades are counted as a different types.
        - Blowguns and Throwing Weapons are counted as different types.
        - For example, if one unit uses a fist, then others can't use fists (however, a fist sidegrade can still be used).
- **Objection Clause**
    - If there are reinforcements,
        - the boss can only be killed when # of enemies <= min{5, # of allies} (since killing Knights and Golems might be too time consuming);
    - Else,
        - the boss can only be killed when other enemies are killed.
- **Incap Clause** - Incapacitated units must be teleported out before three countdowns run out.
- **Heal Clause** - The number of times of using consumebles, and using healing magic, skills and weapons <= 1.5 x (1 + # of enemy clerics) x [# of total enemy units / 3]. And this upper bound is denoted as N, where [n] is the integer part of n.
    - For example, if an enemy team consists of 11 units including 2 clerics then N = 1.5 x (1+2) x [11/3] = 1.5 x 3 x 3 = 13.5. 
    - Healing magic, skills and weapons include Heal, Allheal (Light AOE Heal), Harvest Dance (Art of War), Purify (Water AOE Heal + Cleanse), Time of Need (White Knight AOE TP to HP), etc. 
    - Exceptions. Those granting Renewal are not included. Lancet (Dark HP to HP) is not included since it's fair. Drain Heart (Dark) and magic like that which drains HP from others are not included.
    - Half a heal. Actions that use TP and are not AOE are counted as half a heal, e.g. Feral Remedy. Kirin Blowgun is also counted as half.  (2020/9/27)
    - Necros are counted as "Cleric" and N = 1.5 x (1 + # of enemy clerics) x [(# of initial units + 1/2 # of summoned units) / 3].
- ~~**Consumable Clause** - The number of times of using consumebles <= [N/2].~~ (2020/9/27: Heal and consumable quotas are combined.)
- **Stop Ward Clause** - Equipping the skill Stop Ward is prohibited.
- **Shutdown Clause** - Player can only put one enemy under shutdown status at a time. 
    - Shutdown status is defined as Sleep, Petrify, Shackle and Stop.
	- Also, Rattle is banned. I have shown how op are shutdowns in the video [Tactics Ogre OV mod Heavenly General Maitreya in Phorampa Wildwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Q3n5HnjwE).
	- "At a time" means, when one enemy is shutdown, then you are not allowed to get others shutdown.
	- Exception: you are allowed to shutdown up to 2 units in one action (AOE), however you can only do this when there is no other shutdown enemy.
	- If there exist shutdown enemies and new enemies are shutdown in another action, then the player loses immediately.
	- ~~If more than one enemy is shutdown on the battlefield, the player loses immediately.~~ (might be too restrictive, I will follow this personally.)
	- Note that if you have one enemy shutdown, the charmed one might make another shutdown so you lose immediately according to the rule. So be careful.
- **Grinding Clause**
    - Grinding for experience is not allowed.
    - Highest level in player's party <= lowest level in enemies.
- **Tarot Clause**
    - No Chariot Tarot. 
    - No Tarot card stat bonus.

```
_C1 No Tarot Stat Bonus
_L 0x20025C28 0x34060000
_L 0x20025C34 0x34060000
```

- ~~**Sanctuary Clause** - A unit can't equip both sanctuary and rampart aura.~~ (Fixed in 0.963d)

If you are interested, you may download some saves [here](https://github.com/Shiina18/tactics_ogre_one_vision_mod_challenges) to do some challenges. (2020/9/23)

### For This Run

Given that I refuse to use special classes as often, I would argue that **Cleric** and **Knight** are the most prominent classes: Cleric is the only general class that has access to Heal and Knight is central for defensive purpose (highest HP and DEF + status restoration magic + Rampart Aura + Phanlanx); and they are gods when battling with the undead. **Terror Knight** and **Warlock** are also of great importance: Terror Knight is good at countering Knight (Frighten + Shadow Break) and is also capable of shutting down magicians (Drain Mind, especially useful for bosses); Warlock can shut down others consistently, making the battle much easier according to [Lanchester's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws).

To make the game further harder, I would only use classes available at the very beginning of the game, with Terror Knight not being included. And I will give the Tamer + Dragon combo a shot.

### Interesting Battles 

#### The Gates of Almorica Castle at Chapter 2 Route C

- Version: 0.960
- Targets: Xapan and Ramidos (main target). 
- Enemy: 12 + 6, including 2 Clerics. Level 11.
- Player: 10. Level 11.

##### Teambuilding

- **Warrior (Denam)** Spear with range 2-3

**For classes without magic, it is essential to have high attack range so that the unit can have more opportunities to make an impact on the battlefield.** To give some insight, suppose the move range + attack range = n, then the attainable area is 2n^2 + 2n + 1, ignoring terrain. In this case, move range 5 + attack range 3 = 8, attainable area = 145; while if n=5+1=6, then attainable area = 85, which is way smaller.

In order to employ class skills, melee weapons are favored. So a spear with range 2-3 is chosen.

- **Archer (General Female)** 2-H Bow

Their main attacking targets are casters and archers. Bows are favored given that Crossbows will often be blocked.

Using Bridle to mute magicians is crucial.

2-H Bows are chosen for higher attack range and atk. Archers will typically be killed by archers and magicians, so better stay in a safe place.

- **Wizard (General Male)** Dark and Ice Magic

Dark magic provides an arsenal for controlling in early game.

TP controlling is important. Players should avoid being hit by finishing moves. Ice magic Frostbite is handy for that.

- **Cleric (Donnalto)** Fist; Absorb MP

Fists are light and 1-H, and provide some AVD bonus, so are favored.

Cleric wears light armor to lower RT and to attract some attack. 

Absorb MP: You can drain alley magician's MP when needed.

- **Spellblade (Cistina)** Dagger; Air, Water Magic

This build is for controlling and supporting purposes.

Dagger is used together with Fated Circle to bind enemies. Rank 2 finishing move is also useful to shutdown magicians and to gain MP in the same time.

Air for Grace and flight, Water for healing.

Grace (melee avd up) will be used in Turn 1, and Fated Circle will be used from Turn 2.

Spellblade wears heavy armor. With HP Infusion (and Spike Skin), they can be really tough so more DEF is favored.

- **Knight (Voltare)** Sword

There is no adequate reason for swords. Other options also work.

One advantage is that sword has 2-H variant which is counted as 1-H, so Knight may use 2-H variant to maximize damage (with rank 2 finishing move or Instill Light).

**Unnessary battles should be avoided for TP controlling purpose so that the enemy can't use finishing moves or critical skills frequently.** Typically, Knights should prioritize restoring status for others rather than attacking. Attacking leads to TP accumulation for the target and a counterhit from him which results in HP reduction for the attacker. With sword, Knight can deal damage accurately when it is needed (the finishing stroke). 

- **Berserker (General Male)** Axe

There is no good reason for axes. I just want to give Axes a shot. Breach + damage boosted finishing move is useful. Axe's rank 6 finishing move (double hit) is attractive. 

Equipment with AGI bonus is favored since Berserker already has fewest attacking opportunities, every hit matters.

- **Beast Tamer (Sara)** Throwing Weapon

The reason is the same as Warrior's. And Throwing Weapon deals more damage than other 1-H ranged weapons.

Beast Tamers are much tougher than archers, so they can stand at more dangerous places.

Another import reason for using throwing weapons is that, ideally tamers should use one skill every turn, and using a ranged weapon allows them to find a better position for both attacking and utilizing skills in one turn. (2020/9/14)

- **Air Dragon**

I caught it so I use it.

- **Vartan (Canopus)** Throwing Weapon; Lighting magic; Absorb MP

Vartan is actually squashy. To allow him to attack from a safe place, ranged weapons are preferred and Throwing Weapon has the highest ATK. He can fly and he is not so fragile as archer, so shorter attack range can be tolerated.

Galvanize (melee acc up) will be used in Turn 1, and Trajectory will be used in Turn 2. 

Absorb MP: drain up enemy Cleric's MP.

##### Play

Since this stage is hard, I did some random battles to level up my team from 10 to 11 so that the archer has access to Silence.

The strategy is simple: 

0. In turn 1, melee units will be granted Truestrike + Dodge + Resilient.
1. Shutdown the boss with the archer's silence art of war / spear's rank 2 silence finishing move / air dragon's silence breath / ~~dagger's rank 2 drain MP finishing move~~ (bugged in 0.960 version). Axe's and thrown weapon's rank 2 finishing move can slow her.
2. Kill Xapan first.
3. Hold the frontline with the knight and other units having rampart aura.
4. Kill magicians, push the frontline forward and find an opportunity to kill clerics.

![Lucky to kill the first Cleric fast. Note that the front line is well controlled. (The phantom on the right of Denam is ally's.)](images/20200711174411953_31673.jpg)

![Time to kill the boss. As mentioned previously, Knight, Cleric and Spellblade are the thoughest classes so they usually survive.](images/20200711174553811_30038.jpg)

![I misplayed a lot and there is a bug on heartbreaker, so the party lost heavily. Those phantoms are really annoying without a Terror Knight.](images/20200711174423471_184.jpg)

Heal counts: 17

Consumable counts: 7

#### Brigantys West Curtain Wall at Chapter 3 Route C

2020/8/8

- Version: 0.963a
- Target: Vartan
- Enemy: 13, including 2 Clerics. Level 14.
- Player: up to 12, but I will only use 10, which will make it much harder. Level 13.

##### Points

There is more to this battle than meets the eye.

- From version 0.963 on, tamer + monster combo has its day. The Octopuses are extremely dangerous. In version 0.963, with Empower Beast, they are able to tear apart my archer, mage and vartan by just one hit (Blue Spiral, which is even a long ranged AOE). In version 0.963a, monsters are nerfed a little, so our squashies won't be struck down by a single knock.
- 14 is a critical level: new 2-h bows, light armor, mage armor, AOE magic 2 and so on.
- Due to the Heal Clause, Heal is limited, while the boss vartan will charge to us with archers, mages and clerics left on the bank. According to the Objection Clause, we have to cross the moat and manage to kill them all.
- The terrain is obnoxious, with a large water area and high difference of height on the opposite bank. The arhcers and mages on the bank hit really hard and, with 2 clerics and nasty terrian, it is not easy work to vanquish them. Additionally, Bow's rank 2 finisher Leaden and Cudgel's rank 2 finisher Shackle make life harder.

##### Teambuilding Updates

Wade is a must, and Jump also helps a lot (jumping up 3 tiles is enough).

In hindsight, Squash should also be useful when we reach the other side of the moat.

- **Spellblade** added Ice magic

This battle might be the perfect showcase for Winter Siege.

Winter Siege has been buffed several times (and renamed since the first modification). For the first time Waterwalk is added which is proposed by me. Imagine that we use some ice spell to freeze the water and then walk on it. For this time version 0.963a, it affects multiple targets, which might result from my complain that Winter Siege is inferior to Hover Flight in most cases.

- **Berserker** double attack

##### Play

- Kill the Octopuses before they can activate any damage skill. Don't attack them offhand in the first round or two, which will only help them accumulate TP.
- Lure the melee fighters to the middle of the moat and archers to the shore. Then kill them.
- Vartans can't learn Wade, so they are not able to stay in the water. With that in mind, we can occupy the small island consisiting of 3 tiles in the midst of water and deploy our soliders in the water, so that they won't be approached by the boss.
- Cross the moat, land and slaughter. Do it as quickly as possible since we have a quota of only 12 heal and 6 consumables.

![Two enemy archers have been killed already. Our melee fighers landed safely, while the archer and the mage were killed later by the boss. (I misplayed here.) The hoplite is just too tough, and we'd better bind him and leave him alone.](images/20200808085802835_8829.png)

![Stage Clear](images/20200808085825899_31377.png)

Heal counts: 11

Consumable counts: 4

#### Phidoch South Curtain Wall at Chapter 3 Route C

2020/8/21

- Version: 0.963b beta (not released formally, with some archer and mage set modification)
- Target: Mage
- Enemy: 13 + 10, including 2 Clerics (and possibly more Clerics from reinforcement). Level 16.
- Player: 12. Level 15.

##### Teambuilding Updates

This time we have fresh blood in our crew. 

- **Blade Knight (Hobyrim)**

First time to use blade knight. I will talk more about it in the future.

- **Warlock (Cerya)** Dagger variant (Spellstrike), and equipment that maximizes MND.
    - Air: AOE bind
    - Water: AOE heal; Leaden + Slow + RT delay, very useful to some bosses (e.g. twelve heavenly)
    - Fire/Earth/Ice: shutdown. I use Fire this time since it fits Cerya and turn-based status (shackle and petrify) is easier to track than RT-based (stop) so I can know when it will expire.
    - Lightning: Useful to some bosses, their turn will not come forever.
    - Dark: Similar with Terror Knight. Drain MP, very useful to mage bosses. Charm, useful to units full of TP.
    - Light: Never used.

Carries Water, Fire and Dark this time.

Warlock is one of the best classes in the game. Shutdown status is all OP imo. This build is dedicated to inflicting shutdown status. What's more, **warlock in this build doesn't need any ranked skills**.

Spellstrike is used in Turn 1. And with the help of Instill Mind, she can shut down enemies with nearly 100% acc every turn consistently.

The regular 10 will remain the same and these 2 will only be used when a party of 12 members is called for.

- **Archer**

Has rank 4 bow finisher (sleep) now, which is OP (and this is one of the reasons I prefer bows than crossbows).

Has access to stun-bringer.

- **Knight**

Now uses a shield that inflicts stun.

In hindsight, my spellblade should bring Fire magic to counter Weaken...

##### Points

Though there are 23 enemies in total, it's quite easy to vanquish them all, since (1) we have more useful tools and (2) we have one of the best classes in our team now.

- Lv 16 is a critical level for new weapons and shields.
- There are no terror knights, so Phalanx is very effective.

##### Play

- Spam stun, and trap and delay enemies so that there are fewer active foes in the battlefield and they take fewer effective turns.
- In the first few turns, warlock is tasked with shackling appropriate units (considering there are 2 knights, shutdown isn't very reliable).
- Find an opportunity to drain up boss' MP and then keeps her MP bar clean.
- Kill clerics via applying silence or absorbing their MP.

#### Bahanna Highlands at Chapter 4 Route C

2020/8/29

0.963c

Enemies have higher tier gears, level and projective spell 3. Additonally, all skill ranks of enemies are raised to rank 4 by myself.

Watch the video [here](https://www.acfun.cn/v/ac17664467). Many misplays due to the fact that I forgot to check out the action orders multiple times.

#### Hagia Banhamuba at Chapter 4 Route C

Watch the video [here](https://www.acfun.cn/v/ac17664467_2). It's a slightly different team, and I play better this time. You may see how carefully the dragoons are being treated and I pass my turns doing nothing sometimes just because I can't do anything that is able to bring advantages that turn.

#### Challenge: Knight General in the Forest

2020/9/1

Thank severusia for sharing the save. 

I build a team with her characters and vanquish the knight general (lv. 33) in the forest with a team of lv. 24-27 at the first attempt.

Watch the video [here](https://www.acfun.cn/v/ac17706243) on AcFun or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Q3n5HnjwE&feature=youtu.be) on YouTube. The video partly shows the reason why I have to impose so many restrictions as written previously to make game worth playing.

Tbh, this battle is way too easy partly because it hasn't been reworked yet. 

> Team
> 
> - defensive core: cleric, knight, white knight (can be replaced with knight), lord (can be replaced)
> - offensive core: berserker, terror knight, blade knight (can be replaced with swordmaster), vartan
> - controling core: warlock (rt reset), spellblade (sleeping fan + guaranteed hit), rogue (sleeping blowgun + guaranteed hit)
> - burden: dragoon (sadly useless in this battle) 
> 
> classes can be replaced arbitrarily except cleric, knight and warlock, which are the best classes.

Some strategies I came up with beforehand. Sadly the enemy is so weak that I even didn't have a chance to apply them. The strategy is very general and can be applied using generic classes and generic characters without grinding skill ranks and gears. 

- They don't have shadwobreak/squash, Phanlanx is god.
- High rank rampart aura is god.
- Use silence and MP drain to dispose of healers. In high level, MP drain works very well since maximum MP is much higher.
- Use dragoon to deal with dragons.
- Status might be not effective since they have many healers.
- We have level disadvantage, so the base damage overhead is typically zero. So we 'd better to choose strategies relied on extra damage rahter than base damage. 
- Since they have tons of healers, we should rely on burst damage to finish them one by one. TK's preserved fearful impact +shadowbreak is something I used to use frequently.
- Inflict Stun (hammer +guaranteed hit) to Full Ward enemies, then silence/slow/leaden.
- Prevent enemies from using finishers. (ice magic, art of war, drain power, and some finishers to deal with TP)
- Use flight (air magic) or winter siege (ice magic) to deal with rampart aura.
- ...

In fact, the point is, to lure two dragons throwing, which costs very high RT penalty, then reset their RT forever. So in fact, the match is over when my warlock takes his second turn at around 5:00 of the video.

```
due to [lanchester laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws) which can be applied in this game, shutting down a unit for 2 or 3 turns is invaluable
even if the status is restored immediately later, you can choose the target deliberately to pass at least one of his turn
then you make one move to pass two moves of enemies
that's invaluable in turn-based games
```

To be continued...
