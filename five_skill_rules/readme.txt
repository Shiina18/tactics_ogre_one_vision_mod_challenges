common rules + optional rules

## Leupha Coast

2021/1/4
0.970a

Player: 8 units (10 units at most), rank 4
Enemy: 12 units, rank 4
Heal quota: 8

This is just a simple test to see how the rules work and if they need to be further refined.

The team is quite rough now and can be further refined. For example, with Witch as a teammate, Absorb MP in Trickster is not necessary.

There are also a few misplays in the video. An obvious one is that I overlooked an octopus and was hit by one Blue Spiral.

AOE Renweal is counted as half a heal now.

It seems that Vampiric Kiss might be problematic, and we will see how it performs in later tests, then decide whether to restrict it or not.
