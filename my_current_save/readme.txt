0.963d

There are at least 4 battles you can fight out now.

- Lhazan Fortress. Rescue the dragonborn from a necro. Lv.21
- Potd 3F. Buffed in in 0.963d
- Golyat. Cressida, Nybeth. Lv. 18. Reworked in 0.963d
- Barnicia Castle. Lv.20

I haven't played all of them through yet. 
So I will add more details and may present some challenges later 
when I have time.

I think level 18 should be enough to do all these battles.
