There are 6 battles you can fight out now.

- Lhazan Fortress. Rescue the dragonborn from a necro. Lv.21
- Potd 3F. Buffed in 0.963d
- Golyat. Cressida, Nybeth. Reworked in 0.963d. Lv. 18
- Barnicia Castle. 3 stages in total. Lv.20

I haven't played all of them through yet. 
So I will add more details and may present some challenges later 
when I have time.

I think level 18 should be enough to do all these battles.

With lv.18, we get most of interesting skills available.
And we have gears exactly one generation behind lv.20 enemies.

## The Gate of Barnicia

2020/9/26

Limit: 8 heals and 4 consumables

I have finished the first stage of Barnicia Castle with only my old 10 crew. 
7 Heals (+1 unnecessary heal in the end) and 3 Consumables.

Showed many little tricks in this battle, quite satisfied.

And here is Vital's solution (though broke some rules in midgame): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x3pALuCko64QP2ruYzx4D-KDUfJjl53u/view

Vital's thoughts on the battle:

2h spear was very good on Denam, the range and damage making him one of the better damage dealers on the team. 
He was especially good at dealing with squishy targets as the range helped him reach the backline, while double attack can sometimes be enough to one-shot.
My setup made him very vulnerable to magic however, something I didn't play around enough, which lead to me having to use the chariot in the midgame as he got obliterated by a 3-hit summon.

Knight Commander performed great, fearful impact combined with dual wield regular and sidegrade axes means your second attack can benefit from fear and breach from the first one, which lead to consistently good damage for little tp.
Fear also made Knight Commander one of the few good ways to deal decent damage to tanks.

I planned on using paragon as a second damage dealer but it was a bit too difficult to keep 2 frontliners geared for damage healthy, especially because paragon can't deal a lot of damage normally and needs to use blood price to spam finishers.
Blood price isn't spammable though, because of the heal clause. In fact it's very rare that it's worth going for blood price, so much so that I didn't use it once.
I changed it to a more tanky build but it wasn't amazing. Both damage and CC on the special finishers are a bit lacking.
Shellbust's breach and light averse also doesn't soften enemies up all that much and is negiligible against tanks because of how the mechanics work when you're underleveled.

Knight didn't feel impactful so I tried out swapping him out and was surprised at how much I missed him.
Having a tanky divine user is surprisingly useful as that bulk allows him to stand in the frontlines and always be in range to clear debuffs without worry.
Never thought simply being tanky could be such an advantage over other divine users.

Familiar overperformed. Instrument is amazing with fated circle, which also bumped up spellblade's usefulness quite a bit.
Selfless kiss is also amazing, though I didn't really use it as I misinterpreted the heal clause.
She was surprisingly good as arrow bait, low defenses combined with 165 evasion and rank 3+1 deflect made her block quite a few arrows.

Storm call was oddly good, I can't quantify what impact it made but it felt like the enemy archers hit less than usual.

Barnicia Courtyard

2020/10/3

0.963e

Heal and consumable quota: 18
Used: 16.5

It's easier than 1st stage. Finished it with the old 10 crew.
However, I played much worse this time with tons of misplays.
Showed how to make use of monsters and how to imprison a unit.
