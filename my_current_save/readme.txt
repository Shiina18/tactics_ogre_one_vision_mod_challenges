0.963d

There are 6 battles you can fight out now.

- Lhazan Fortress. Rescue the dragonborn from a necro. Lv.21
- Potd 3F. Buffed in 0.963d
- Golyat. Cressida, Nybeth. Reworked in 0.963d. Lv. 18
- Barnicia Castle. 3 stages in total. Lv.20

I haven't played all of them through yet. 
So I will add more details and may present some challenges later 
when I have time.

I think level 18 should be enough to do all these battles.

With lv.18, we get most of interesting skills available.
And we have gears exactly one generation behind lv.20 enemies.

## The Gate of Barnicia

2020/9/26

Limit: 8 heals and 4 consumables

I have finished the first stage of Barnicia Castle with only my old 10 crew. 
7 Heals (+1 unnecessary heal in the end) and 3 Consumables.

Showed many little tricks in this battle, quite satisfied.

And here is Vital's solution (though broke some rules in midgame): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x3pALuCko64QP2ruYzx4D-KDUfJjl53u/view
-knight commander performed great, fearful impact + dual wield means your second attack can benefit from fear and breach which lead to pretty consistently good damage for little tp
-I planned on using paragon as a second damage dealer but it was a bit too difficult to keep 2 frontliners geared for damage healthy, especially because paragon can't deal a lot of damage normally and needs to use blood price to spam finishers
-speaking of blood price, it's really not something you want to use because of the heal clause
-knight didn't feel impactful but having a tanky divine user is surprisingly useful as that tankyness allows him to stand in the frontlines and always be in range to clear debuffs without worry, never thought simply being tanky could be such an advantage over other divine users
-familiar was surprisingly good as arrow bait, low defenses combined with 165 evasion and rank 3+1 deflect made her block quite a few arrows
-storm call was oddly good, I can't quantify what impact it made but it felt like their archers hit less than usual
