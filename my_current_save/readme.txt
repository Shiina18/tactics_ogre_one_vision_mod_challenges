**ULUS10565DATA00**

There are 6 battles you can fight out now.

- Lhazan Fortress. Rescue the dragonborn from a necro. Lv.21
- Potd 3F. Buffed in 0.963d
- Golyat. Cressida, Nybeth. Reworked in 0.963d. Lv. 18
- Barnicia Castle. 3 stages in total. Lv.20

I haven't played all of them through yet. 
So I will add more details and may present some challenges later 
when I have time.

I think level 18 should be enough to do all these battles.

With lv.18, we get most of interesting skills available.
And we have gears exactly one generation behind lv.20 enemies.

_C0 All Professions Level 18
_L 0x402E7E90 0x00500002
_L 0x00000012 0x00000000
_L 0x402E7E94 0x00500002
_L 0x000017e9 0x00000000

Challenge: only use 10 units.

Proposed Cressida challenge: 
- Set all enemy skills to rank 6.
- Set all 5 bosses max hp to 700. 

**barnicia_finished**

There is another save where Barnicia is finished and Catiua is recruited.

- Lhazan Fortress, Potd 3F, Golyat (Cressida) -> Pirate
- Grimsby (Lindl) -> Head Hunter
- Subsequent battles to Heim
- 6 Fortress (not reworked yet)

It seems that I'd better finish the Cressida battle at first since it's only level 18.

Proposed challenge:
Fight Iorumza Canyon and Boulder Sands simultaneously.
1. Build two teams of 19 units in total, with no duplicate classes.
	Denam + 9 units for each team. Following the common rules, there are up to 2 special classes on each team.
	Use one team to fight Canyon and the other to fight Sands.
	Denam is not allowed to be incap.
2. Use cheatcodes to set all enemies ranks to 7. Refer to the tutorial in the main page.
3. Level 20 should be enough. 

_C0 All Professions Level 20
_L 0x402E7E90 0x00500002
_L 0x00000014 0x00000000

When using cheatcodes to set untrained skill ranks, the following are reference values.
rank 4-6 for weapon, supporters like spellblades tend to have lower ranks like rank 4 since they have fewer chances to attack physically.
rank 3 for elem aug
rank 2-3 for parry/deflect

And here is Vital's solution (though broke some rules in midgame): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x3pALuCko64QP2ruYzx4D-KDUfJjl53u/view

Vital's thoughts on the battle:

2h spear was very good on Denam, the range and damage making him one of the better damage dealers on the team. 
He was especially good at dealing with squishy targets as the range helped him reach the backline, while double attack can sometimes be enough to one-shot.
My setup made him very vulnerable to magic however, something I didn't play around enough, which lead to me having to use the chariot in the midgame as he got obliterated by a 3-hit summon.

Knight Commander performed great, fearful impact combined with dual wield regular and sidegrade axes means your second attack can benefit from fear and breach from the first one, which lead to consistently good damage for little tp.
Fear also made Knight Commander one of the few good ways to deal decent damage to tanks.

I planned on using paragon as a second damage dealer but it was a bit too difficult to keep 2 frontliners geared for damage healthy, especially because paragon can't deal a lot of damage normally and needs to use blood price to spam finishers.
Blood price isn't spammable though, because of the heal clause. In fact it's very rare that it's worth going for blood price, so much so that I didn't use it once.
I changed it to a more tanky build but it wasn't amazing. Both damage and CC on the special finishers are a bit lacking.
Shellbust's breach and light averse also doesn't soften enemies up all that much and is negiligible against tanks because of how the mechanics work when you're underleveled.

Knight didn't feel impactful so I tried out swapping him out and was surprised at how much I missed him.
Having a tanky divine user is surprisingly useful as that bulk allows him to stand in the frontlines and always be in range to clear debuffs without worry.
Never thought simply being tanky could be such an advantage over other divine users.

Familiar overperformed. Instrument is amazing with fated circle, which also bumped up spellblade's usefulness quite a bit.
Selfless kiss is also amazing, though I didn't really use it as I misinterpreted the heal clause.
She was surprisingly good as arrow bait, low defenses combined with 165 evasion and rank 3+1 deflect made her block quite a few arrows.

Storm call was oddly good, I can't quantify what impact it made but it felt like the enemy archers hit less than usual.

## Barnicia Courtyard

2020/10/3

0.963e

Heal and consumable quota: 18
Used: 16.5

It's easier than 1st stage. Finished it with the old 10 crew.
However, I played much worse this time with tons of misplays.
Showed how to make use of monsters and how to imprison a unit.

## Barnicia Grand Staircase

2020/10/4

0.963e

Heal quota is 12, and is run out of in mid-game. 
I failed first time, and used a quick save in mid-game and tried the second time. 
Finally achieved it with 10 units with only classes available in ch. 1. 
This stage is harder so I had to use some powerful classes (terror knight and rogue) rather than running with my regular suboptimal crew.
Some chariots are used, but I didn't abuse it to get better RNG or something like that.

tips:
- if an enemy archer used double shot when he ends his turn, 
you may use any ranged attack to trigger his counterhit in order to release the double shot 
so that the archer doesn't do too much damage in the next turn.

In this battle I tried out abusing spike skin by equiping Denam in a way that makes him less tanky than all the other frontliners and thus a priority target for the enemy AI.
I then equiped him and the valkyrie in a way so Denam has slightly lower RT than the valkyrie so the valkyrie could always go after Denam and apply spike skin for his turn.
The idea was Denam taking every attack on the frontline while spike skin is active, making my frontline nigh invulnerable.

Syncing up rt with the valkyrie failed horribly from the very beginning.
It's not very doable to do so and even with 3 spike skin users there were a lot of moments where denam was exposed to multiple enemy turns without spike skin.
Not to mention how Denam sometimes simply isn't in range of the enemy while another teammate is.
So the strategy can't quite make my frontline take almost no damage, however it still worked out quite well.
Denam took a lot of arrows especially so a spike skin right before consecutive archer turns prevents a lot of damage.

I gave Denam str gloves and 2h spear to make him a bigger target for spike skin.
It turned out very well and Denam was the best damage dealer besides the knight commander while spike skin kept him alive while he was in position to deal damage.

I replaced a wizard with a shaman for the spike skin strategy, shaman has a lot of utility but I did miss extend and conserve rt.
I tried putting a weapon skill on her since she doesn't have ways to spend TP otherwise but those finishers were pretty anemic.

I added another healer, which was pretty amazing.
Familiar can't handle all the healing on her own and with a cleric as the main healer, familiar gets freed up to do other stuff, which is a lot more valuable than healing I think.
The utility provided when she doesn't have to heal is pretty insane.
Despite being fully geared for evasion, it's still necessary to position her away from potential arrows as 165 evasion just doesn't seem enough to consistently avoid them unfortunately.
Selfless kiss is even better now that she's not the main healer so an urgent heal never got in the way of a well timed selfless kiss.

I'm starting to like knight more and more.
Multiple divine users to clear debuffs is an absolute must and knight fills that role amazingly well while providing defensive utility and area control.

Absorb mp is amazing and it makes me want to try mana drain claws on spellblade instead of dagger as I didn't even bind any enemies with it.
