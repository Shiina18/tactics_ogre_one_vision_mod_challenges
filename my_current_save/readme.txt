0.963d

There are 6 battles you can fight out now.

- Lhazan Fortress. Rescue the dragonborn from a necro. Lv.21
- Potd 3F. Buffed in 0.963d
- Golyat. Cressida, Nybeth. Reworked in 0.963d. Lv. 18
- Barnicia Castle. 3 stages in total. Lv.20

I haven't played all of them through yet. 
So I will add more details and may present some challenges later 
when I have time.

I think level 18 should be enough to do all these battles.

With lv.18, we get most of interesting skills available.
And we have gears exactly one generation behind lv.20 enemies.

## The Gate of Barnicia

2020/9/26

Limit: 8 heals and 4 consumables

I have finished the first stage of Barnicia Castle with only my old 10 crew. 
7 Heals (+1 unnecessary heal in the end) and 3 Consumables.
