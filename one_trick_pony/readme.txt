0.970a

New classes: Octopus, Gryphon, Cyclops

Team used lv. 24

- consumable: Mend Leaf
- offensive core
	- Octopus, Blue Spiral. It's the god in swamp.
	- Tamer, Thrown sidegrade, Empower Beast
	- Vartan, Thrown sidegrade, Enrage (fire). To buff ranged attackers and the monster.
	- Rogue, Thrown sidegrade, Bullseye
	- Warrior, Thrown sidegrade, Vigorous Attack
- defensive core
	- Knight, 1h Sword, stun shield, Rampart Aura
	- Cleric, Claw, Heal 1
	- Sibyl, Book, Protection (draconic). Protect Octopus majorly. Protection is suited for a blitz like this battle, since there are 3 bosses (1 tamer and 2 beasts), the game has a quite fast tempo.
- AI
	- Spellblade (Ravness). 1h Katana, Purify (water)
- burden
	- Spellblade, 1h Katana, Electrify (lightning). Not needed.
	- Cleric 2, Book, Tabula Rasa. Not used at all.
	
Not a good team. 

- Thrown users are too many and they have quite poor acc without Bullseye. 
- Prepared a Spellblade to charge TP, while tamer and octopus are never short of TP.
